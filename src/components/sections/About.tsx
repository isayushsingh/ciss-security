                Civil Industrial Security Services (CISS) was established with a singular vision: to raise the standard of private security in Uttar Pradesh.

            <p>
                We understand that security is not a "one size fits all" solution. Whether it's a bustling mall needing friendly crowd control 
                or a remote factory needing strict access protocols, we tailor our deployment to match your specific risk profile.
                Our guards are not just watchers; they are trained responders.
